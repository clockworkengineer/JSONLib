# JSONLib
Parse JSON into an internal JSON Object (generating an exception if it is found not to be syntactically correct) so that it can be manipulated,
interrogated and saved back to a text form (stringify).For an in-depth description of the JSON specification refer to its RFC at web address
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.
